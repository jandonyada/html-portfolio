<h1>The Best Movies According to Jan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</h3>
<p>
  That scene when Gandalf brings the Rohirrim to aid King Theoden during the
  siege of Helmsdeep. Goosebumps.
</p>

<h3>Edge of Tomorrow</h3>
<p>
  How Tom Cruise relives the day over and over, slowly becoming a killing
  machine on is mech suit is so awesome.
</p>

<h3>Constantine</h3>
<p>The name's John Constantine. Asshole. Epic movie.</p>

<h3>Bonus movie: John Wick series</h3>
<p>
  What's not to love about this fucking series. The russian mobster, the
  Indonesian duo, Cain the blind swordsmen. Weapons sommelier. Sigh. So good.
